# AdminBundle

This is the admin system I've been using for the past few years for my projects.
I've decided to do some upgrades (inspired by easyadmin) and publish it, but I'm mainly doing this for myself, so that I don't have to maintain this package on a per project basis anymore.
However, if the community likes it, I'm willing to put some time into it.

## Why not easyadmin then?
EA is great. They are doing marvellous work, and if you just need an admin package for a front facing system, it should be fine.
My clients mostly require backend heavy apps, so people mostly use the "admin" part, which lead me to conclude:
- EA's url structure is very ugly, and cannot be sufficiently customized.
- EA's filters are not the way I would do it
- I would rather not have specific JS plugins, css etc in the package. Themes can be published using separate repositories. The approach to themes should encourage DIY, instead of providing one.
